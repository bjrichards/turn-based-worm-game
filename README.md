# Turn Based Strategy Game - UNDER *slow* DEVELOPMENT

## Description
Turn based strategy game being created for JS practice as well as to recreate a Flash game from my childhood that is no longer available (due to Flash being dropped by browsers).

Development is slow since this is one of the lower priority projects on my GitHub.

## Dependency Instructions
This project is built fully in JavaScript. It does take advantage of canvas functionality from P5.js.

P5.js is linked directly via url, so there is no need to download the build of it to include in the project.

#### Run Application
This application requires a webserver to function properly on local. My most favorite way requires python:
```bash
  python -m http.server
```
This will allow the project to be accessed via http://localhost:8000/
